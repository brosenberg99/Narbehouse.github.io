# Web scan implementation and Companion 1.0.7

The web upgrade covers all 26 catalogue games, six tools, legacy Mini Golf, Hub menus/Settings and Companion. The owner reports the local changes working well. On October 4, 2026, the owner reported 1.0.7 submitted and awaiting approval, with 1.0.5 still public. Store status has not been independently checked in the publisher dashboard.

This public map replaces the chronological working ledger; its complete original, task notes, backups and test attempts remain preserved locally. Current policy is maintained in [ACCESSIBILITY.md](bennyshub/ACCESSIBILITY.md) and [the developer guide](developer-guide.html). See [validation](submission/VALIDATION.md) and [the test checklist](SCAN-UPGRADE-TESTING.md).

## Current behavior

- Stationary CHOICE menus use the shared scanner. Moving/timed MECHANIC surfaces retain native timing, input ownership and gameplay.
- Roots start blank and include recurring -1 in both directions. Step blank is silent/inert. Auto with Parking Off passes blank silently; only chosen/automatic parking permits Park/Parked narration. Parked Enter resumes the first item without activating it.
- Auto supports chosen parking or 1–3 completed loops, Space brake and owned speech completion plus a full interval. Existing guards, release selection, holds and multiplayer switch ownership remain.
- Scan pause uses only a dotted outline, without visible Paused text or badge. Game/video Pause menus remain. Parked clears highlights and reveals its existing status host.
- Parking/Loops/Brake/Wait settings live only in Hub Settings. Auto-only options remain visible but disabled when unavailable; Loops also needs Auto park. Values/selection persist. Existing local Auto/speed/voice options stay.
- Settings uses normal page scrolling. Input Sensitivity follows Auto; Size follows Background Theme. Selected items stay above the measured footer. Native disclosure/form input has one owner.
- Nested Back restores the parent row/item. Child entry starts at its first item; completing the child loop returns to root blank. Fresh roots and explicit separate modal returns may reset. No minimum press or extra debounce was added.
- Physics, difficulty, art and native holds remain. Racer's approved pre-race pause-access notice is included. Tap-friendly gameplay alternatives and hold-game warnings remain future work.

## Scope and port flags

SHARED identifies relevant behavior for both products; COMPANION identifies the browser extension; WEB-ONLY identifies website-only work. COPY-AS-IS means copy a verified helper unchanged after authorization. RE-PORT means compare/adapt the integration against the real desktop app. ADAPTER means implement the platform contract. WEB-ONLY means no desktop copy. No flag claims completed Electron work.

## Shared and platform file map

All helper filenames below are relative to `bennyshub/shared/` unless a full path is shown.

| Files | Scope | Responsibility | Port |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `platform.js` | SHARED | Browser settings, speech tickets, matched input capture and activity lifecycle. | ADAPTER |
| `scan-manager.js` | SHARED | Central validated preferences and existing sensitivity guard. | COPY-AS-IS |
| `choice-scan.js` | SHARED | Blank loops, parking/brake, owned speech waits, held inputs and nested contexts. | COPY-AS-IS |
| `choice-scan-adapter.js` | SHARED | Explicit app IDs/contexts, redraw/group/Back/pointer mapping; no polling or extra global listeners. | COPY-AS-IS |
| `voice-manager.js` | SHARED | Started/finished/cancel tickets and bounded speech completion. | COPY-AS-IS |
| `scan-status-badge.js`, `scan-status-badge.css` | SHARED | Dotted selected-choice feedback and reserved Parked status. | COPY-AS-IS |
| `scan-settings.js` | SHARED | Portable centralized controls retaining option identity. | COPY-AS-IS |
| `bennyshub/index.html` | SHARED | Hub/Settings ownership, normal page/footer visibility and disclosure boundaries. | RE-PORT |

| `bennyshub/setup.js`, `bennyshub/extension-setup.html`, `bennyshub/companion-privacy.html` | WEB-ONLY | Setup/return flow, package link and storage/access disclosures. | WEB-ONLY |

## Companion file map

Files below are relative to `extension/`; every row has scope COMPANION and port WEB-ONLY.

| Files | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `player-platform.js` | Validated Hub-settings facade and extension platform adapter. |
| `player-content.js` | Shared scanning, existing guard, compact control row, Help and independent toolbar speech. |
| `player-view.js`, `player-adapters.js` | Reserved video/caption frame, constrained provider layouts, fullscreen recovery and cleanup. |
| `background.mjs` | Validated managed-player transport, live settings and serialized speech preference persistence. |
| `player-registration.mjs`, `policy.mjs` | Granted-host registration, dependency order, validated preferences and production origins. |
| `options.html`, `options.css`, `options.mjs` | Single Streaming and news switch, ten static platform names and separate Calendar. |
| `manifest.json` | Version 1.0.7 without added permissions. |
| `shared/choice-scan.js`, `shared/voice-manager.js`, `shared/scan-status-badge.js`, `shared/scan-status-badge.css` | Exact copies of canonical helpers. |
| `shared/scan-status-badge-style.js` | Generated CSS text for the player shadow root. |

The normal accepted dock is 60 px high. The ordered buttons scroll at narrow widths and reveal the selected choice; video/captions fit above them. Mute/Unmute controls media audio. Help's Toolbar Speech defaults On, persists locally and synchronizes across managed windows without altering Hub voice or media volume. Explicit Say I need help still speaks when automatic narration is Off. Unlock/Relock, Return to Hub and provider sign-in remain available.

Streaming and news grants/revokes the existing origin set together. Full access says On. Partial access says Incomplete and can be removed immediately; Off then On requests the complete set. Refused/incomplete operations cannot claim full success. Calendar, libraries and unrelated preferences are preserved.

## App map

Folders below are beneath `bennyshub/apps/`; each named file is relative to its app and shares the row's scope/port flag.

## Release and validation

Companion 1.0.7 is **101,050 bytes / 26 members**, SHA-256 `51cc9dfb80e6eb2eb47341fd9abb11861ea17e98f857dcabd26e6f49007172f0`. Only its manifest version differs from accepted 1.0.6-blanket-access. Independent ZIP/CRC/unpacked checks, production scoping, shared parity and website-download parity passed. All 24 prior archive copies were unchanged.

The runtime baseline passed 142 unit tests; grouped-access settings passed 16 Edge UI groups. Version promotion passed three targeted existing package/shared-sync tests. All catalogue apps have recorded stationary-choice acceptance; focused later suites cover dotted feedback, the inline toolbar, independent speech and silent Parking Off. These overlapping fixtures are not exhaustive playthroughs. [Validation](submission/VALIDATION.md) records coverage and manual limits.

Local-only evidence roots: `artifacts/scan-web-complete/`, `artifacts/scan-outline-only/`, `artifacts/quiet-loop-final/`, `artifacts/companion-master-access/`, `artifacts/companion-1.0.7/`. Evidence, profiles and old ZIPs stay outside public source/build. Full source/document snapshots remain in the owner's external Website Backups directory.

## Publication cleanup

The pre-publication snapshot preserves the full previous ledger and source. Raw task notes and the one-time historical archive audit remain local. Public instructions use maintained accessibility/developer guidance; local evidence is listed without broken public hyperlinks. Release-owner cleanup removes retired prediction experiments, retains active prediction behavior, preserves submitted package bytes with scoped Git attributes, pins build tooling and checks the tracked Companion checksum.

### Final pre-push verification

The staged source was exported with Linux-style line endings, without local runtime/build/release files. All **142 unit tests** pass; the public build/audit and all **905 references** pass. The build has **1,179 files / 354,390,252 bytes**. Its Companion ZIP exactly matches the submitted SHA-256 in `submission/COMPANION-SHA256SUMS.txt`. These byte counts describe the clean Git export; previous local worktree reports may differ in web text line endings.

The complete pre-publication source snapshot contains **1,550 files**, with hashes verified before removal. **16 retired files / 17,575,492 bytes** were archived and removed. Earlier release archives remain unchanged and excluded from Git. Local pre-push evidence is stored under `artifacts/prepublish-1.0.7/`; it is not published. GitHub deployment and live checks follow the push and are not implied by this pre-push record.

## Scan Speed correction — 2026-10-04

Scan Speed stays enabled in both Step and Auto modes, since it also sets the interval for held backward scanning. Auto Scan, Input Sensitivity and Scan Speed share the first row; only Parking, Loops, Brake and Wait depend on Auto. Existing values and stable selection are retained. The correction passes 142 unit tests, 18 Settings browser groups, responsive/footer checks at three sizes, public build/audit and 905 links. Companion 1.0.7 bytes are unchanged.

## Sphere Splash recorded commentary — 2026-10-07

Not scan work: no shared helper, scan context, input or timing changed. Sphere Splash's broadcast now plays recorded voices for every line (player calls, formation lines and their descriptions, on top of the earlier families), and its commentary queue was corrected so a goal's call, score and analyst line, and the full-time winner, are all heard. Commentary still never speaks over a choice; checks confirm Auto Scan with Wait for Speech keeps stepping through decisions. The game is not in the Hub catalogue; its Exit still returns to the Hub.

## ELECTRON PORT PLAN — LOCKED

No desktop files were changed. This plan may start only after the user tests/confirms the web changes and explicitly says **"start the Electron pass."**

Desktop root: the separate Electron source location supplied privately by the owner, outside this repository.

### COPY-AS-IS destinations after authorization

These policy/helper files go to the same relative destination beneath that desktop root, unchanged after verification:

| Web source | Electron destination relative to desktop root |
| --- | --- |
| `bennyshub/shared/scan-manager.js` | `bennyshub/shared/scan-manager.js` |
| `bennyshub/shared/voice-manager.js` | `bennyshub/shared/voice-manager.js` |
| `bennyshub/shared/choice-scan.js` | `bennyshub/shared/choice-scan.js` |
| `bennyshub/shared/choice-scan-adapter.js` | `bennyshub/shared/choice-scan-adapter.js` |
| `bennyshub/shared/scan-status-badge.js` | `bennyshub/shared/scan-status-badge.js` |
| `bennyshub/shared/scan-status-badge.css` | `bennyshub/shared/scan-status-badge.css` |
| `bennyshub/shared/scan-settings.js` | `bennyshub/shared/scan-settings.js` |
| `bennyshub/ACCESSIBILITY.md` | `bennyshub/ACCESSIBILITY.md` |

App integrations marked RE-PORT keep their same relative folders from the app mapping above. Compare desktop versions first; do not overwrite whole app folders, catalogs, data, Electron bridges or native launch behavior. New standalone choice bridges may be copied only after confirming their app APIs match. Web-only YouTube Search, Companion transport, setup/download pages, tool gate and service worker do not belong in that copy.

### Desktop platform adapter

Implement the same contract at `bennyshub/shared/platform.js`:

- **Settings:** `settings.open({key,normalize,project,onChange})` returns `readCached()`, `save(value)`, `reload()`. Desktop scan settings currently use localStorage; voice settings also use `electronAPI.voice` IPC and cache. Supply synchronous cached defaults, settle later native loads, preserve existing keys/unknown fields, and propagate live changes without echoes.
- **Speech:** voices and voice-change subscription; `speak(text,options)` returns `{started,finished,cancel}`; `cancel()` settles the owned request. Map actual native start/end/error/cancel events through existing voice IPC. Shared voice policy owns the cap. Missing engine events must never strand scanning or let a stale utterance advance another context.
- **Input:** `input.capture(handler)` supplies original matched Space/Enter/NumpadEnter press/release events before app handlers exactly once. Preserve player-owned multiplayer switches and native holds. Do not reintroduce desktop's old minimum-press filter or double-register browser plus native events.
- **Lifecycle:** `lifecycle.onActivity(callback)` with cleanup, mapping focus/visibility/native activation. Clear half-held inputs and restart a full interval on resumption.

### Python streaming control bar

Re-port behavior in `bennyshub/apps/tools/streaming/utils/control_bar.py`: recurring blank stop, silent Step deadzone, Auto chosen/loop parking, visible Parked status, Enter resume without activation, and Space brake tap/hold/full-interval resume. Read the Hub's saved scan mode, interval, sensitivity and new parking/brake fields through its existing settings transport. This Python scope is **park and brake only**; do not invent speech-wait support or replace media/navigation controls. Preserve its native hold thresholds. Messenger's separate Python bar and backend are not this control bar.

### Desktop acceptance before any sync claim

Back up the complete working desktop first. Test speech end/failure/timeout/cancellation, recorded-label completion, IPC/cache startup races, storage persistence, live settings, duplicate key capture, valid short releases, native long holds, focus loss, app/iframe ownership, multiplayer keys, all nested returns and visible status at the actual desktop window sizes. Re-run the per-app web checklists with the real desktop engines. Audit COPY-AS-IS hashes and mark every ledger entry DONE ON ELECTRON or NOT NEEDED only after verification.

Desktop-only Pet Pals, Sphere Splash, Web Search, Messenger and RT Convo remain unverified and require their own scope and checklists. Do not label them web-tested.
