# Building for Benny's Hub

For the web companion experiment, installation, connection diagnostics, provider
permissions and data management belong in the collapsed **Settings** area
at the top of the Hub. These controls use ordinary mouse/keyboard interaction
and stay outside switch scanning (`data-scan-exclude`). The original Streaming
editor stays behind its existing mouse/keyboard warning. Keep the player's main flow focused on opening and
using tools; companion troubleshooting must not become a required scan stop.
When a companion tool becomes unavailable, preserve work and offer a switch-
accessible **Back to Hub**, with technical detail inside the settings disclosure.

**Read this before you write a line of code for this hub.**

Everything here exists so that one person can play a game by himself. Not "with
help." Not "with a caregiver driving the mouse." By themself. If a feature you
add cannot be reached with a single switch, it does not exist for the player
this hub is built for.

---

## 1. Who this is for

Benny's Hub supports people who use one or two switches to access tools and games.

Assume your player:

- **Has one or two reliable voluntary movements.** That might be a hand, a
  cheek, a head turn, a knee. It is mapped to a switch, and that switch is the
  entire interface.
- **Cannot use a mouse, a touchscreen, a d‑pad, or a keyboard** in the ordinary
  way. No pointing, no dragging, no aiming, no two things at once.
- **May be slow to press, and slow to release.** A press might last a fraction
  of a second or four seconds, and that variation is not intentional.
- **May press by accident**, or twitch, or bump the switch — and the game must
  not punish that.
- **May not read**, or may not read quickly. Speech is not a bonus feature; for
  many players it *is* the interface.
- **Is not a child, and should not be talked to like one.** The games are real
  games with real difficulty. The access is what is adapted, not the dignity.

The disability is physical. Do not confuse "needs one switch" with "needs an
easier game."

### Build for the whole range, not one player

That said, "one switch" describes an input, not a person. The players who reach
this hub differ enormously — in stamina, in reaction time, in reading, in how
much challenge they *want*. A game pinned to a single difficulty will always be
frustrating for one end of that range and boring for the other.

Two things solve this, and both are already patterns in the hub:

**Difficulty and no‑fail modes.** Give the player a way to choose how hard the
game pushes back. Race Tracks ships a **Cruise mode** with no fail state at all,
sitting alongside a ten‑level Race ladder — same game, same controls, opposite
ends of the range. Bowling and Mini Golf let players pick opponents and player
counts. A no‑fail mode is not a lesser version of the game; for a player who
tires quickly or who plays to relax, it is *the* version.

**Editors.** Let players and caregivers build their own content. This is the
highest‑leverage accessibility feature in the whole hub, because it hands the
difficulty dial to the person who actually knows the player. Several games
already do it:

| Game | Editor |
| --- | --- |
| NARBE Mini Golf | Course Creator |
| Benny's Matchy Match | card‑pack editor |
| Benny's Show n Sound | panel/category editor |
| Trivia Master | full quiz builder |
| Benny's P3GL | Campaign Editor |

An editor turns one game into an unlimited number of them, tuned by a parent, a
teacher, or a therapist to the specific person in front of them — vocabulary
they're working on, pictures of their own family, a course short enough to
finish in one sitting. **When you build something new here, ask early whether it
can have an editor.** It is almost always worth it.

**Today's editors need a mouse and keyboard and are not switch‑operable.** That
is an accepted starting point — they are caregiver tools, and they earn their
place by what they let a caregiver build. But it makes the way *in* to them
dangerous for a switch user, so **every editor sits behind a spoken warning
dialog**. See §7, "Warn before a one‑way door" — that pattern is not optional.

The longer‑term goal is a player building their own content independently.

### Independence is the whole point

The measure of every screen in this hub is a single question:

> **Can the player get from the hub's front page, into this game, through every
> menu, into a round, out to the pause menu, into settings, and back to the hub
> — alone, using one switch?**

If the answer is no anywhere along that chain, that is a bug, and it is a more
serious bug than a crash. A crash is obvious. A screen that quietly requires a
second person is a player losing the ability to play by themself.

## 2. What a "switch" actually is

An adaptive switch is a large, forgiving button — sometimes a pad, a lever, a
proximity sensor, a sip‑and‑puff tube. It plugs into a **switch interface** that
emulates a keyboard, and that interface sends exactly one thing:

| Physical switch | What the browser receives |
| --- | --- |
| Switch 1 | `Space` keydown / keyup |
| Switch 2 | `Enter` keydown / keyup (also `NumpadEnter`) |

For the great majority of hardware that is the whole story. **A game that
handles `Space` and `Enter` correctly is switch‑accessible.** You never talk to
switch hardware; you handle two keys.

### Why those two keys

They are not an arbitrary pick, and they are not a formal standard either. They
are the vendors' own default: AbleNet's Blue2 ships configured as Space and
Enter (switchable to 1/2/3/4), and Pretorian states plainly that "to provide
switch access to most AT software, Space and Enter is often all that you will
need." They also match the web platform — a native HTML `<button>` activates on
**both** Space and Enter — so the hub is using the two keys the browser, the
screen reader and every keyboard user already treat as "move on" and "choose."

The relevant standard underneath all of it is **WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard**: every
function must be operable through a keyboard interface. Which keys is our call.

### The exception: interfaces that send no keys at all

Some hardware does not emulate a keyboard. AbleNet's **Hook+** uses Apple's
Assistive Switch Events, and anything driving **iOS Switch Control** or a
similar platform switch API works the same way — the operating system does the
scanning and delivers a *tap* to whatever is highlighted, and no `keydown` ever
arrives.

**This is why mouse and touch support is not a caregiver nicety.** It is the
entire access route for those players. A control that only responds to Space and
Enter is invisible to them; one that is a real, clickable element works. Treat
consequence 3 below as accessibility, not convenience.

One thing genuinely untested: platform Switch Control runs *its own* scan over
the page, which may collide with the hub's Auto Scan. Nobody has tried it. If
you have the hardware, that is a worthwhile afternoon.

Three consequences that catch people out:

1. **A switch has no "click" — it has a press and a release, and they can be far
   apart.** Never act on `keydown` for a menu action. See §4.
2. **There is no third key.** Not Escape, not arrow keys, not letters. If your
   feature needs a third input, redesign the feature. (There is no remapping
   setting either — §12 records why, and where it would go if ever built.)
3. **Mouse and touch must also work, in parallel** — for caregivers, for
   therapists setting a game up, for players who have touch or eye‑gaze, and for
   the platform‑switch‑API users above. For everyone else they are an
   *addition*; for those users they are the only route in.

---

## 3. The two control schemes

The hub supports both, and every game must support both. The player chooses
once, in Settings, and the choice is remembered globally across every game.

### Two‑switch (Auto Scan **OFF** — the default)

The player drives both halves of the interaction.

- **Space** = move the highlight to the next item
- **Enter** = select the highlighted item

### One‑switch (Auto Scan **ON**)

The highlight moves *by itself* on a timer. The player only confirms.

- **The highlight advances automatically** every 1, 2, 3, or 4 seconds
- **Enter** = select whatever is highlighted right now
- Space still works for players who can hit it, but nothing *requires* it

The scan interval is the player's reaction budget. Someone who needs four
seconds is not being slow — that is their body's latency, and the setting exists
so the game meets it.

Auto Scan defaults to **off** and 2000 ms
(`shared/scan-manager.js`, `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`).

### In‑game, the same two schemes apply

This is where games differ most, and where the design work is. Race Tracks is
the clearest worked example (`apps/games/BENNYSRACETRACKS/js/ui.js`):

- **Two‑switch:** hold Space to steer left, hold Enter to steer right.
- **One‑switch:** hold Enter to move in the direction currently armed; releasing
  arms the opposite direction, so a quick tap swaps sides.

Note what that one‑switch mode does: it turns *one* button into a full
two‑direction control by making **release** meaningful. That trick — press does
one thing, release arms the next — is the single most useful pattern in this
codebase. Reach for it before you conclude a mechanic can't be done with one
switch.

---

## 4. The universal input contract

Every screen in the hub and every game obeys this. Deviating from it is how you
strand a player who has learned the pattern everywhere else.

| Gesture | Where | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Space**, short press | Any menu | Move highlight forward — **on release** |
| **Space**, hold | Any menu | Scan **backwards**, repeating at the player's scan speed |
| **Enter**, short press | Any menu | Select the highlighted item — **on release** |
| **Enter**, hold | In‑game | Open the pause menu |
| Mouse click / tap | Anywhere | Same as selecting that item |

### Which of these numbers the scan manager actually owns

This trips people up, so be precise about it. **`NarbeScanManager` owns two
values and no others:**

- the **scan interval** — 1, 2, 3 or 4 seconds, the player's setting, which is
  also the repeat rate once backwards scanning has started
- the **input sensitivity** — 50, 100, 200 or 300 ms, the player's setting,
  used for the debounce and the anti‑rapid‑press check

**It does not own the hold thresholds.** There is no backwards‑scan threshold
and no pause threshold in `scan-manager.js` at all. Those are hard‑coded
separately inside each game — the same `3000` appears in at least thirteen
files under its own name (`longPress`, `SCAN_BACK_HOLD`, `HOLD_THRESHOLD`,
`BACKWARDS_SCAN_THRESHOLD`), and Bowling writes it as `3.0` seconds because it
runs off a Three.js clock.

Two consequences:

1. **The convention is ~3 s to start scanning backwards and ~5 s to pause**, and
   new games should match it — but it is a convention held together by
   copy‑paste, not a value anything enforces. A game can drift without breaking
   a build or failing a test. P3GL already has (§12).
2. **Never promise a specific duration in any text, player‑facing or not.** The
   repeat rate genuinely varies per player, and the threshold is whatever that
   particular game happens to hard‑code. "Hold Space to scan backwards" is true
   everywhere; "hold for 3 seconds" is true only until someone edits one file.

If these thresholds are ever worth standardising, the fix is to put them in
`scan-manager.js` next to the values it already owns.

### Never quote these numbers to the player

The thresholds above are for **you**, the implementer. Player‑facing text — help
screens, hints, footers, and anything spoken aloud — says **"hold Space to scan
backwards"** and **"hold Enter to pause."** No seconds, no numbers.

Two reasons. The repeat rate once backwards scanning starts follows the player's
own scan‑speed setting, so any number printed next to it is wrong for most
players. And a player who is told "hold for 5 seconds" and counts to five while
nothing visible happens will reasonably conclude it is broken — the ring and the
rising beeps are what communicate progress, not a number they read once.

Keep control hints to the shortest true sentence. Show n Sound's footer is the
house style:

> `Tap Space = next · hold Space = back · Enter = choose`

### Act on release, never on press

A player may hold a switch down for seconds without meaning to. If you fire on
`keydown`, a long press becomes a runaway repeat and the player loses control of
the screen. Fire on `keyup`, and check how long the press lasted:

```js
// Menu handling, the way every game in this hub does it
function onKeyUp(e) {
  if (key === 'Space') {
    if (heldLongerThan(3000)) return;  // that was a backwards-scan hold
    focusNext();                        // ordinary short press
  } else if (key === 'Enter') {
    activateFocused();
  }
}
```

### Menus open with nothing highlighted

When a menu, screen or dialog appears, **nothing on it is highlighted.** The
player's first Space press highlights the first item, and scanning carries on
normally from there.

| On a menu that has just opened | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| **Space**, short press | Highlights the **first** item and speaks it |
| **Space**, hold | Highlights the **last** item, then keeps scanning backwards |
| **Enter** | Nothing. There is nothing to select yet |
| **Auto Scan** | The first tick, one full scan interval after the menu opens, highlights the first item |

The reason is the press that opened the menu. The player may still be holding
that switch, or it bounces, or they twitch just after selecting. If the new
menu arrives with its first item already highlighted, that stray Enter selects
it, and the player ends up somewhere they never chose. When nothing is
highlighted, a stray Enter does nothing, so every choice on a new screen starts
with a deliberate Space.

"Appears" covers every way a menu can come up:

- at launch
- going into a submenu
- **coming back to a menu with Back.** Don't restore the item the player left
  from.
- the pause menu
- results and game‑over screens
- the warning dialogs in §7

On open, speak the menu's title or prompt but not the first item's label,
because that item isn't highlighted. A warning dialog still speaks its whole
warning on open.

The rule does **not** cover two things:

- **Changing a value in place.** Cycling Voice or Scan Speed, toggling a
  setting, or arming a two‑step Reset leaves the player on the same menu, so
  the highlight stays where it is. Keep the index even when the code rebuilds
  the screen to show the new value.
- **Scans that are part of taking a turn.** This means a board's row and
  column scan, the cards, letters or answers in play, P3GL's **Play / Pause**, and Mini Golf's Easy Pause putter scan and Choose‑from‑List power
  list. These come round on every move, so an extra press there is a cost the
  player pays on every move (§12). If the player navigates *through* it, it
  opens with nothing highlighted. If it's part of playing, leave it alone.

Tools follow the same rule when the tool opens and when any of its screens or
dialogs opens. Scan resets in the middle of using a tool, such as the keyboard
going back to row scan after a letter, are part of using it and stay as they
are.

The hub front page (`bennyshub/index.html`) is the reference. It sets
`focusIndex = -1` on every screen change and when a game closes.
`focusNext()` goes from −1 to the first item, `focusPrevious()` goes from −1 to
the last, and `activateFocused()` only speaks a hint at −1. In a game it comes
down to four small changes (NARBE Mini Golf's `js/ui.js` is a worked example):

```js
let index = -1;                                    // -1 = nothing highlighted

function openMenu(items, title) { menu = items; index = -1; render(); speak(title); }
function focusNext() { index = index < 0 ? 0 : (index + 1) % menu.length; showFocus(); }
function focusPrevious() { index = index < 0 ? menu.length - 1 : (index - 1 + menu.length) % menu.length; showFocus(); }
function activateFocused() { if (index < 0) return; menu[index].action(); }
```

Every piece of code that reads the focused item has to cope with −1: speaking
it, drawing it, showing its description, and canvas hit tests. Clear both the
visual highlight and the stored scan selection; hiding the border alone still
lets Enter activate an invisible choice. Do not use Enter to start scanning.

Some grids already use −1 for a real Back button. Streaming uses `null` for
nothing highlighted so that Back remains a normal scan stop. Whichever marker
you use, skip disabled or hidden items when finding the first or last choice.
Restart the Auto Scan timer on a screen change, including when returning from a
dialog, so the new screen gets a full scan interval. Keep Auto Scan working
inside warning dialogs and tool keyboards.

### Why pause is a long hold

Pause has to be reachable from inside a game where both switches are already
doing something else. A long hold is the only gesture left that cannot collide
with gameplay. It is deliberately long enough that no one opens it by accident,
which means the gesture must be **discoverable while it happens** — otherwise
it is a secret.

Race Tracks does this properly and is worth copying: partway through the hold a
progress ring appears and starts filling, a **rising beep** plays each second so
it works with eyes closed, and the menu opens when the ring completes. The
player can see and hear that something is happening and that continuing to hold
will finish it.

Every game must also offer an **on‑screen Pause button** doing the same thing,
for mouse, touch, and caregivers.

### Debounce is handled for you — mostly

`shared/scan-manager.js` installs capturing listeners on `keydown`, `keyup`,
`mousedown`, `mouseup`, `click`, `touchstart` and `touchend`, and filters
Space/Enter through the player's **Input Sensitivity** setting — 50, 100, 200 or
300 ms, defaulting to 50. A switch that physically bounces, or a player with a
tremor who double‑hits, gets one clean press. You do not need to write your own
debounce, and you should not.

**It is a buffer after a press, not a minimum press length.** A press of any
duration counts — tap it, or hold it for four seconds — and then nothing else
registers until the buffer has elapsed. Two checks do the work:

| Check | What it blocks |
| --- | --- |
| **Cooldown after a valid release** | a second press arriving too soon after the last one |
| **Anti‑rapid‑press** | a new press arriving too soon after the previous *release*, so fast tapping is not read as one long hold |

Both block a keydown **and** consume its matching keyup, so a filtered press
never reaches a game half‑finished. And because press *length* is never
filtered, the hold gestures behave identically at every setting — hold‑to‑scan‑backwards
and hold‑to‑pause work the same at 300 ms as at 50 ms.

**Mouse and touch are not filtered.** They are direct navigation for caregivers
and therapists, not switch input, and bounce is a property of physical switches.

**One deliberate difference from the desktop hub.** Desktop has a third check: it
rejects presses *shorter* than the threshold by swallowing the keyup. That is not
ported, and must not be, because by the time the keyup arrives the game has
already seen the keydown and started whatever the press begins. Swallowing the
keyup leaves that running with nothing to stop it — see §11.

## 5. Shared modules

All live in `bennyshub/shared/` and are loaded by each game's `index.html`
before its own scripts. Load order matters: `safe-audio.js` first, then
`voice-manager.js`, then the rest.

### `scan-manager.js` — `window.NarbeScanManager`

The global scanning contract. **Settings persist across every game in the hub**
via `localStorage` (`narbe-scan-settings`), so a player configures their access
once, not twenty times.

```js
NarbeScanManager.getSettings()        // { autoScan, scanSpeedIndex, scanInterval }
NarbeScanManager.getScanInterval()    // ms: 1000 | 2000 | 3000 | 4000
NarbeScanManager.toggleAutoScan()
NarbeScanManager.cycleScanSpeed()
NarbeScanManager.subscribe(cb)        // fires when settings change, incl. from another tab
NarbeScanManager.getInputSensitivity() // the 250ms debounce constant
```

Subscribe rather than polling — the hub and games share settings live through
the `storage` event.

### `voice-manager.js` — `window.NarbeVoiceManager`

Text‑to‑speech, and the **single source of truth** for the chosen voice and
whether TTS is on. Never keep your own copy of that state; read it from here.

```js
NarbeVoiceManager.speak(text)
NarbeVoiceManager.getSettings()          // { ttsEnabled, ... }
NarbeVoiceManager.toggleTTS()
NarbeVoiceManager.cycleVoice()
NarbeVoiceManager.getCurrentVoice()
NarbeVoiceManager.getVoiceDisplayName(v)
NarbeVoiceManager.waitForVoices()        // promise — voices load async
```

Speak on **focus change** and on **selection**, and speak outcomes. Speech must
never block input.

### `safe-audio.js` — `window.SafeAudio`

Sound effects through plain HTML5 `<audio>`, deliberately **avoiding the Web
Audio API** — an `AudioContext` can take down the renderer in the Electron
desktop build. Same code, sound on web and desktop.

```js
SafeAudio.preload('roll', 'sound/roll.wav');  // file-backed
SafeAudio.preload('select');                  // NO url -> synthesised built-in
SafeAudio.play('select', 0.6);
SafeAudio.setEnabled(bool);                   // master mute
```

Built‑in synthesised names, no asset files needed: `select`, `hover`, `score`,
`bank`, `bust`, `fahtzee`, `win`, `lose`.

> **Trap, and it has bitten this repo:** `preload(name, url)` caches the entry on
> first call. Preloading a built‑in name with a URL that 404s permanently
> shadows the synthesised sound, and the failure is *silent* — no error, just no
> sound. If you want the built‑in, pass **no URL at all**.

### `ios-audio-fix.js`

Unlocks WebAudio and SpeechSynthesis on first touch for iOS/mobile. Include it;
nothing to call.

### `tutorial-modal.js` — `window.BennyTutorial`

The shared how‑to‑play modal, with an embedded video. Shows a "Video coming
soon" placeholder when a game has no video yet, so an unfinished tutorial is
never a blank black box.

---

## 6. How the hub itself works

`bennyshub/index.html` is the front door, and it is scanned with the same two
keys as everything else.

**Structure:** Home → Games *or* Tools → (optional Genre filter) → paginated
grid, **9 items per page** → launch.

**Games and tools are data, not markup.** The grid is built at runtime from
`apps/games/games.json` and `apps/tools/tools.json`. Adding a game means adding
a JSON entry — you do not hand‑write cards:

```json
{
  "id": "bennysracetracks",
  "title": "Benny's Race Tracks",
  "description": "A 3D racing game you steer with a single switch...",
  "path": "apps/games/BENNYSRACETRACKS/index.html",
  "image": "images/games/bennysracetrack.png",
  "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"]
}
```

`genres` drives the hub's genre filter, so pick from the existing vocabulary
where one fits.

**Games run in an iframe** inside the hub, with a `← Back` button in the header.

**Exiting back to the hub** is a message, and all 23 games implement it:

```js
window.parent.postMessage({ action: 'focusBackButton' }, '*');
```

The hub listens for that, closes the game, and returns to the launch menu with
nothing highlighted. The first Space starts scanning again (§4). **Any new game
must send this** when the player chooses "Exit Game" so they can return using
the same switches.

**Hub settings:** highlight colour, highlight style (outline or full), text
colour, background theme, UI size, TTS on/off, voice, Auto Scan, and scan speed.

---

## 7. The standard shape of a game

Every game in the hub follows the same skeleton. Match it — the consistency *is*
the accessibility. A player who learns one game has learned the shape of all of
them.

### Main menu
Reachable at launch, scanned with Space/Enter. Typically: Play / New Game, mode
or difficulty choices, **How to Play**, **Settings**, **Exit Game**.

### Settings
Reachable from the main menu, and again from the pause menu — because a scan
speed that turns out to be too fast has to be fixable *without abandoning the
round*. The canonical set, in this order
(`apps/games/BENNYSRACETRACKS/js/ui.js` is the reference):

| Item | Values |
| --- | --- |
| Text to Speech | On / Off |
| Voice | cycles available voices |
| *(game‑specific options)* | e.g. Direction Help, Ball Style, Theme — and any timing/hold toggle §9 calls for |
| **Auto Scan** | `On — One Switch` / `Off — Two Switches` |
| **Scan Speed** | 1 s / 2 s / 3 s / 4 s |
| Sound Effects | On / Off |
| Reset Progress | two‑step confirm |
| ← Back | returns to previous screen |

Label Auto Scan with what it *means* — "One Switch" / "Two Switches" — not just
On/Off. It is the control‑scheme selector, and the person changing it is often a
caregiver setting the game up for someone else.

**Reset Progress must be two‑step.** A single mis‑scan should never erase
everything; the item arms first and only wipes on a second, deliberate select.

### Pause menu
Opened by holding Enter, or by the on‑screen Pause button — **both, always**. The
hold alone is not enough: a player who cannot sustain a hold has no way in
through it. Standard items: **Continue**, **Restart**, **Settings**, **Main
Menu**, **Exit Game**, and where useful a **Help** item that speaks a line
without closing the menu.

In a new game, prefer making Pause something the player can also **scan to and
select**, with the hold kept as a shortcut. §12 covers what that costs and when
it is the right call.

### Persistence
Save progress as it happens, to `localStorage`. A player who gets tired
mid‑session should come back to where they were. Access settings are global via
the shared managers; game progress is the game's own.

### Warn before a one‑way door

**Any action that takes the player somewhere they cannot get back from with a
switch must be behind a confirmation.** This is the single most important
safety pattern in the hub, and it exists because of how scanning fails.

A scan cursor moves on its own, or moves on a press the player may not have
meant. A mis‑timed Enter is not a rare event — it is the normal failure mode of
switch access. If a mis‑scan lands on a menu item that opens a mouse‑only
editor, the player is now looking at a screen they cannot operate, cannot exit,
and did not ask for. Nobody is coming to help unless somebody happens to walk
past. That is the exact loss of independence this whole hub exists to prevent.

The editors are the main case. **They need a mouse and keyboard, and are not
switch‑operable.** Every game that has one already guards it:

| Game | On-screen | Spoken on open |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trivia Master | Full overlay, plain wording | "Warning. Opening the game editor will leave this site." |
| NARBE Mini Golf | "Mouse Required" card | the entire warning, verbatim |
| Benny's Word Jumble | "Warning: This feature requires a mouse or touch input…" | "Warning. This feature requires mouse input. Cancel. Proceed." |
| Benny's Show n Sound | "Continue (mouse needed)" | "The editor needs a mouse and keyboard." |
| Benny's P3GL | "Mouse needed" card | the entire warning, verbatim |
| Benny's Matchy Match | `editorWarning` menu state | warns that it needs a mouse and that switch scanning will not work |

Copy this when you add anything similar:

1. **Confirm first, always.** Never let a single select open a mouse‑only
   screen. Put a dialog in front of it.
2. **Put the safe option first in the scan order.** Cancel before Continue. If
   the player mis‑scans *again* inside the warning dialog, the accident should
   land on the way out, not the way in. Trivia Master and Mini Golf do this;
   Matchy Match currently lists Continue first, which is the wrong way round.
3. **Trap the scan inside the dialog.** While the warning is open, the scan list
   must contain only the dialog's own buttons — a warning you can scan straight
   past is not a warning. Trivia Master's `getScannables()` is the model: it
   returns the overlay's items and nothing else while it is visible.
4. **It must be spoken, the moment the dialog opens.** Not when the player
   scans onto an option — *on open*. Many players do not read, and for them an
   unspoken warning is not a weak warning, it is **no warning at all**: they
   see a screen change they cannot interpret and press their switch again.
   Speak the consequence before they can act on it.
5. **Say what will happen, in plain words.** "You will not be able to scan and
   select with your switch" beats "this feature is advanced." Name the thing
   they lose — scanning — not the thing the feature is.

Speaking only the option labels is not enough. A player hearing "Continue" and
"Cancel" has been told there is a choice, but not what makes one of them
dangerous.

The same applies to anything else that strands a switch user: leaving the site,
opening a new window, a file picker, or any external tool. If you cannot get
back with a switch, warn before going in.

## 8. Per‑game notes

All 23 games implement the §4 contract, the pause menu, the settings screen, and
the `focusBackButton` exit message. What varies is the *in‑game* input, which is
where each game's design work went.

| Game | In‑game input model |
| --- | --- |
| **Benny's Race Tracks** | Two‑switch: hold Space = left, hold Enter = right. One‑switch: hold Enter to move the armed way, release to swap sides. Optional star per level; Cruise mode is no‑fail. |
| **Benny's Bowling** | A two‑object scan layer opens every ball — the ball itself and the Pause button — scanned with Space and selected with Enter. Selecting the ball gives the shot: Space oscillates position, then aim, on a 5 s sweep — release to lock. Enter charges for power, non‑linear. Confirms on **release**, not press. Pause is a scan object rather than a hold gesture because hold‑Enter is already the charge. |
| **Benny's P3GL** | Three modes — Cozy (never runs out of balls), Vivid and Hyper — each with three 20‑level campaigns. Two‑switch: **hold** Space to sweep the aim, release to stop, and each new press reverses direction so the player walks it onto the target; release Enter to fire. One‑switch: the aim sweeps by itself at the Aim speed; press Enter to freeze it and release to fire. Hold Enter to pause (ring and rising beeps). **Before Each Shot: Aim right away / Choose Play or Pause** puts a two‑stop choice in front of every shot — the board, or the on‑screen Pause button in the bottom‑left corner — scanned and selected like a menu, so pausing never needs a hold. Aim speed defaults to Super slow; aim guide length, colour and size are settings. Includes a Campaign Editor. |
| **Benny's Baseball** | Turn‑based play calling — scan the options, select — with one exception: the swing is **hold Enter to charge**, 0–2 s bunt, 2–4 s normal, 4–6 s power, released against the pitch. That is a timing mechanic; §9 governs it. |
| **Benny's Football** | Turn‑based play calling — scan the options, select. Throws scan the receivers and select one, then **hold Enter to charge** the power; field goals aim, then charge. **Easy Throw** in settings drops the charge and keeps the selection: pick the receiver and it throws at ideal power. The hub's shipped example of the §9 rule. |
| **Benny's Basketball Shooter** | Oscillating power meter — the charge sweeps up and down, release to shoot. Same "stop the sweep" family as Bowling and P3GL, no reaction test. |
| **Pickleball Rally** | Rally returns via scan/select. Built with SCSU, student creator Lily Flack. |
| **NARBE Mini Golf** | 3D. Two-switch: hold Space to turn the aim (each new press reverses), hold Enter to charge and release to putt. One-switch: the aim sweeps by itself and Enter stops it. Hold Enter to pause; the **Easy Pause** setting (for players who can't hold) starts every turn with a scan between the putter and the Pause button, so pausing never needs a hold. A Power setting adds no-hold options — pick the strength from a list, or Automatic. The aim view never moves while aiming. Up to 4 players; includes a Course Creator. |
| **Benny's Battle Boats** | Two‑stage grid selection: scan the row, select, then scan the column, select. The standard way to reach a 2‑D grid with one switch. |
| **Chess & Checkers, Connect Four, Tic Tac Toe** | Same two‑stage grid selection; scan pieces/columns, select, scan destinations, select. |
| **Benny's Matchy Match** | Two‑stage grid selection over the card layout — scan the row, select, then scan the card, select to flip (`scan.mode` toggles `row`/`col`). Memory, no timer. Includes a pack editor. |
| **Benny Says** | Simon‑style sequence repetition, deliberately **without** the timing pressure of the original. |
| **Benny's Word Jumble / Trivia Master** | Scan letters or answers, select. Trivia Master includes a builder for your own quizzes. Trivia Master has **no hold‑to‑pause**: Pause is a scan stop after the last answer, and a long Enter press just selects. |
| **Benny's Dice** | Select to roll, scan to choose which dice to keep. Yarkle, Fahtzee, Free Throw modes. |
| **Benny's Bug Blaster** | Tower defence — scan placement positions and upgrades, select. Turn‑paced, not twitch. |
| **Benny's Mega Slot** | Cause and effect: one press spins, immediate audio‑visual payoff. |
| **Benny's Show n Sound** | Cause and effect: a spinning‑wheel See 'n Say. Press to spin, hear the panel named. Phaser‑based. |
| **Benny's Fish Mystery** | Aim and charge the cast by scan, then **press to set the hook while the take is on** and **hold to reel**, easing off on a run. Timed on the hook, hold‑based on the reel; §9 governs both. Three.js, with a content editor. |

For in‑game specifics beyond this, each game's own source is authoritative;
Bowling additionally ships a full `README-ACCESSIBLE.md` documenting its
adaptation, and is a good model for what to write when you adapt someone else's
game.

## 9. Design rules

### Never require
- Timing precision, reflexes, reaction tests, or a sustained hold **as the only
  way through** — these are allowed as *a* route, never as the only one. See
  "Timing may be a challenge, never a requirement" below
- Dragging, or holding one input while operating another
- More than two inputs, ever
- Reading, without speech as an alternative
- Two hands, or any specific limb

### Timing may be a challenge, never a requirement

The rule above says never require timing. It does not say timing cannot exist.

Some games are the thing they are because of a moment of timing — a swing
charged and released against a pitch, a hook set while the fish is still on, a
jump that has to leave the ground before the gap does. Strip the moment out
entirely and you do not get an easier game; you get a menu that plays itself,
and you have taken something away from every player who could meet the window
and enjoyed meeting it.

For a player who can meet a timing window, that window is the game. For a
player who cannot, it is a wall, and slowing it down does not turn a reaction
test into something they can do — it just makes the wall arrive later. So the
rule is not "remove it." The rule is:

> **Any mechanic that depends on timing, reflex, or a sustained hold must ship
> alongside a route through it that needs neither — and a setting that switches
> between the two.**

Both are real versions of the game. The no‑timing one is not a practice mode,
not a baby mode, and not worth fewer points — it plays the same game, scores
the same way, and unlocks the same things.

**Separate the decision from the execution.** This is the whole method, and it
is easier than it sounds. Almost every timed action in a game is two things
stacked together:

- **A decision** — which receiver, what kind of swing, where to aim, whether to
  take the shot at all. This is the interesting part, and the player should keep
  making it.
- **An execution** — holding for the right duration, releasing on the right
  frame, pressing inside a window. This is the part that tests the body rather
  than the judgement, and it is the part the toggle removes.

**Keep the decision. Drop the execution.** Football is the clean example: the
decision is *which receiver*, and the player scans and selects one either way.
With the charge on, they then hold to set power. With **Easy Throw** on, the
selection is the whole action — pick the receiver and it throws at ideal power.
Nothing about the choice changed; only the wrist did.

So the three common shapes resolve like this:

| Timed form | What is left when the execution comes out |
| --- | --- |
| **Hold to charge**, release for strength, power or distance | The selection that was already there carries the action on its own and the game supplies the power (Football's Easy Throw). Where the power level *was itself* the decision, name the levels and let the player scan them — Bunt / Normal / Power, Light / Normal / Full |
| **React inside a window** that opens and closes on its own | Hold the window open until the player selects. The decision survives; the deadline does not |
| **Hold to sustain** something — a reel, a throttle, a brake | Resolve it in discrete steps, one press per step, or as a single select that plays out on its own |

**The game still resolves the outcome.** A selected swing is not an automatic
hit and a selected hook is not a guaranteed fish. The choice goes into the same
resolution the timed version fed, alongside difficulty, position, and luck —
exactly the way a turn‑based play call already resolves. The player chose; they
did not skip.

**Two options is the whole shape of it.** The setting is a toggle, not a
difficulty ladder: charge, or do not charge. Do not add a menu step that decides
nothing — if the action already has a selection in it, that selection *is* the
no‑hold version, and the toggle just stops asking for the hold afterwards.

**There is already one of these in the hub.** Benny's Football throws by
scanning the receivers and selecting one; with the charge on, a hold then sets
the power. **Easy Throw** in settings drops that second half — select the
receiver and it throws at ideal power, and field goals kick at ideal power once
the aim is locked — so a full season plays with no sustained press anywhere. It
is offered in both the main‑menu and the pause settings, it persists, and it is
spoken on toggle. That is the shape to copy. The one thing to do better is the
name: "Easy Throw" labels the player rather than the mechanic, and only the hint
underneath says what actually changes.

**A setting is what lets both players have what they need.** §12 sets out the
honest trade: a hold keeps play quick and direct for a player who can manage
one, and shuts out a player who cannot, while putting a control on the scan
cycle lets everyone in and adds a step in front of every action for the rest of
the session. A toggle settles that instead of dodging it — the player who needs
the select route turns it on, and the player who does not is never left waiting
on a step they will never use. That is why this rule asks for *a setting*, not
for "make everything scannable." It is usually a smaller change than it sounds,
too: the select form appears **at the moment it is needed** — a swing menu when
the pitch comes — rather than becoming a permanent stop on the way to every
shot.

**Where the setting lives.** It is an ordinary game‑specific settings item, in
the slot §7 reserves for them, and it must be reachable from **both** the
main‑menu settings and the pause‑menu settings. A player who discovers
mid‑round that they cannot meet the window has to be able to fix it without
abandoning the round — the same reason Scan Speed appears in both places.
Persist it with the game's other settings.

**Label it by what it changes, not by who it is for.** "Swing: Hold to Charge /
Pick a Swing" tells a caregiver exactly what will be different. "Easy Mode"
tells them nothing, and tells the player something untrue about themselves.

**Not every game here does this yet, and that is worth saying plainly.** The
hub was built around what Ben can do. The controls were tuned to one person's
movements, and that is why they work as well as they do — they were tested
against a real body every day, not against a guideline. The reach turned out to
be much wider than one player, which is the whole reason the hub was opened up.

But building around one person's capabilities means the places where other
people's differ did not always get designed for. Charge‑and‑release is the
clearest case: it suits Ben, it suits a lot of players, and for a player who
cannot sustain a hold it is simply a closed door. That is not a flaw in the
games — they do what they were built to do — it is the next thing to build.

So: **some shipped games do not have the alternative yet, and will get it.**
Which ones still owe a toggle, and what each toggle is planned to be, lives in
§12 — that is where current status belongs, and it will go out of date as the
work lands. This section is the rule going forward. It applies to anything built
from here on, and it is the direction the existing games are moving in.

**Default to the reachable form in anything new.** Same reasoning as P3GL's
Aim speed defaulting to Super slow: a player who cannot meet the window may
never get far enough into the game to find the setting that would have let them
in, while a player who wants the timed version will find it in the first
minute. A game that already shipped with the timed form keeps its current
default when the setting is added, so nobody's game changes under them.

**What this rule does not overturn.** Some sustained holds in the hub have no
alternative today, and this rule does not retroactively make them bugs:

- **Hold Space to scan backwards** and **hold Enter to pause** — the §4 contract
  gestures. Backwards scan is a shortcut, not a requirement; the forward scan
  reaches everything on its own. Pause is the real gap, and §12 carries both the
  reasoning and the direction for it.
- **Controls where the hold *is* the control** rather than a charge laid on top
  of one — Race Tracks' hold‑to‑steer, P3GL's hold‑to‑sweep. These are
  continuous inputs, not timed windows, and §12 explains why the hold‑first
  build is the current answer for them.

Those are known, recorded, and not open work. The rule governs what you build
from here, and it is the direction the rest is moving in — it is not an
instruction to go retrofitting.

**This is not a licence for reflex games.** The timed form still owes
everything else in this document — it fires on release, it needs no drag, no
second limb, no third input, and an accidental press must not cost the player
anything they cannot recover from. And the toggle is not a way to defer the
design: if you cannot describe how the game plays without the timing or the
hold, the mechanic is not ready to build.

### Prefer
- Turn‑based and stepwise mechanics
- Oscillating aim the player *stops*, over aim the player *steers*. Offer both
  forms where you can: **player‑driven** (moves only while held, each press
  reverses — precise, but needs a hold) and **self‑driven** (sweeps on its own,
  one press commits — needs no hold). P3GL swaps between them with Auto Scan
- Make the speed of anything that moves on its own a **setting**, defaulted to
  the slow, accessible end — P3GL's Aim speed defaults to Super slow
- Two‑stage selection (row, then column) to reach a grid — Battle Boats,
  Connect Four, Chess & Checkers, Tic Tac Toe and Matchy Match all use it
- Generous or absent time limits
- No‑fail modes alongside competitive ones — Race Tracks' Cruise mode is the
  pattern

### Visual
- High contrast by default; large targets (**≥ 64 px** on tablet)
- A highlight that is unmistakable — colour *and* thickness, not colour alone
- Never signal state with colour alone
- Generous spacing; a near‑miss scan step must not look like the right one

### Speech
- Speak on focus, on selection, on outcome, and on error
- Speak the *meaning*, not the label: "Auto scan on. One switch. Enter plays the
  game."
- Keep it short — it is read aloud at every scan step, and at a 1 s scan speed a
  long label becomes a drone
- Never block input while speaking

## 10. Shipping checklist

Before a game goes into `games.json`:

- [ ] Every action reachable with **Space and Enter only**
- [ ] Every action reachable with **Enter alone**, with Auto Scan on
- [ ] Menu actions fire on **release**, not press
- [ ] Every menu and dialog opens with nothing highlighted; first Space highlights
      the first choice, hold-Space starts at the last, and Enter waits for selection
- [ ] Auto Scan waits a full scan interval after entering or returning to a menu
- [ ] In-place setting changes retain focus; new screens and Back clear it
- [ ] Holding Space scans backwards in every menu, repeating at the player's
      scan speed from `NarbeScanManager` — not a rate you picked
- [ ] Holding Enter opens pause **from anywhere in gameplay**, with a visible
      and audible indication while holding
- [ ] An on‑screen Pause button does the same
- [ ] Settings reachable from **both** the main menu and the pause menu
- [ ] Auto Scan and Scan Speed present, reading from `NarbeScanManager`
- [ ] TTS reads focus, selection, and outcomes, via `NarbeVoiceManager`
- [ ] Sound through `SafeAudio` — no `AudioContext`
- [ ] Reset Progress is two‑step
- [ ] Exit Game sends `postMessage({ action: 'focusBackButton' })`
- [ ] Mouse and touch work everywhere, and **no interaction requires a drag**
- [ ] Any timing, reflex, or hold‑to‑charge mechanic has a **route through it
      needing neither timing nor a hold, behind a settings toggle**, offered in
      both the main‑menu and pause‑menu settings (§9; games that predate the
      rule are tracked in §12)
- [ ] Anything mouse‑only or off‑site sits behind a **spoken confirm dialog**,
      with Cancel first in the scan order and the scan trapped in the dialog
- [ ] Progress saves and resumes
- [ ] Readable at 100 % on a tablet
- [ ] Added to `apps/games/games.json` with a thumbnail and genres
- [ ] **Played start to finish with one switch, by someone who is not you**

That last one is the only test that actually counts.

## 11. Known gaps and traps

Honest notes for whoever works on this next.

**`narbe-input-cancelled` is listened for but still never dispatched — and this
is now a known blocker, not a curiosity.** Eleven games register a handler for
it. They are not wrong: they were written against the *desktop* scan manager,
which fires the event when it discards a press for being too short. The web
build has never had that check, so the handlers have never run.

**This was tested the hard way.** The Input Sensitivity port briefly brought
desktop's minimum‑hold check across, which swallows the keyup of a too‑short
press. Twelve of the twenty‑three games have no `narbe-input-cancelled` handler,
and they stranded immediately: Benny Says sets `spaceIsDown` on keydown and only
clears it on keyup, so a swallowed keyup left it scanning backwards forever,
with releasing the switch doing nothing. Bowling, which *does* have the handler,
was fine. The check was removed again the same day.

So the position is:

- **Do not add a minimum‑hold check** until either every game handles
  `narbe-input-cancelled`, or the guard buffers the keydown rather than blocking
  the keyup. Blocking a keyup whose keydown already reached the game is the bug.
- **The eleven handlers are harmless** and should stay — they are the safety net
  the day someone does this properly.
- **Games missing the handler**, for whoever picks this up: Benny Says, Baseball,
  Basketball Shooter, Chess & Checkers, Dice, Football, Show n Sound, Tic
  Tac Toe, Word Jumble, Elouise's Word Search, Pickleball Rally.

**`getInputSensitivity()` kept going missing, and now we know why.** It was
removed by a revert and by a rewrite, and each time it silently broke
Space/Enter in games that call it — a `TypeError` inside a keyup handler,
invisible to the player, who simply finds the game unresponsive.

The cause was not carelessness. Until the Input Sensitivity port, the web build
of `scan-manager.js` had a **stub**: a getter with no setter, returning a
hard‑coded constant, with nothing in the hub able to change it. It read exactly
like dead code, so it kept getting pruned. The working version had always been
in the desktop hub; the web fork simply never received it.

It is now a real setting, so the incentive to delete it is gone. If switch input
dies across multiple games at once, still check this method exists first.

**`developer-guide.html` used to disagree with the shipped code** — it described
hold‑Space as enabling *forward* auto‑scan and put the pause hold at 1.5 s.
Corrected to match what runs. If you find any other document quoting control
timings, this file is the authority; fix the other one.

**Sound that 404s fails silently.** Covered in §5, repeated here because it cost
real debugging time: a `SafeAudio.preload()` pointed at a missing file caches a
broken entry and permanently shadows the built‑in synthesised sound, with no
console error.

**Self‑hosted SVGs need explicit `width`/`height`.** A `viewBox` alone is enough
for Firefox and for plain `<img>` tags, but Chrome's WebGL texture upload needs
an intrinsic pixel size — a Phaser‑based game like Show n Sound renders a blank
panel instead. Same class of problem: cross‑origin images without
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` blank out in WebGL games while working fine in
DOM‑based ones.

---

## 12. Known direction — do not "fix" these yet

Deliberate decisions and planned changes, recorded so the next person doesn't
either break them or duplicate the thinking. **None of these are open work
items.** The controls as they stand work, and changing them is not on the table
right now.

**Games reach pause differently, and that is currently fine.** Some offer an
on‑screen Pause button you scan to; others use the hold‑Enter gesture; most do
both. The inconsistency is accepted for now.

**Trivia Master has switched (2026‑10‑02, at the user's request).** The
hold‑Enter gesture is gone and the header's Pause button is a scan stop. It sits
after the last answer, so a round still goes question → first answer with no
extra press. Pause is only added to the scan on the game screen, because the
header stays visible on the end and settings screens. If the player pauses in the
moment between picking an answer and the next question loading, the next
question waits for Continue.

**One known deviation from the ~5 s convention:** P3GL's long Enter hold takes
**2 s** when Auto Scan is on and 5 s when it is off (`holdToPause()` in
`apps/games/BENNYSPEGGLE/js/game.js`). The campaign‑mode rebuild kept both
values because it kept the controls players already knew; a player who cannot
hold turns on **Before Each Shot: Choose Play or Pause** instead. No comment or
commit message records why the time varies, and it is the only game that varies
the hold by control scheme. Worth a decision when pause gets revisited — either
it is a good idea that belongs everywhere, or it should fall back in line with
the rest of the hub. Do not assume it was accidental, and do not assume it was
deliberate.

**Where it is going: pause should become a scannable item everywhere.** Holding
a switch for five seconds is itself a physical demand, and some players cannot
sustain a hold at all — for them the hold gesture is not an accessible route to
pause, it is a locked door. The long‑term intent is for every game to expose
pause as something you can *scan to and select*, with the hold gesture kept as a
convenience rather than the only way in. When you build a new game, favour a
scannable pause entry; do not go retrofitting the existing ones yet.

**But understand what it adds before you reach for it.** Making a control
scannable puts another stop on the scan cycle, and the player meets that stop on
*every single pass*, for the whole session. A game whose only in‑play control is
"fire" lets the player settle in and play. Add a scannable Pause, and every shot
now means waiting through Pause to reach Fire — a player who never opens the
pause menu is still waiting on it, all session.

So the honest trade is: **a hold keeps play quick and direct for the players who
can manage one, and shuts out the players who cannot; a scannable control lets
everyone in, and puts a step between every player and the thing they came to
do.** Neither is simply better.

P3GL is the worked example, and it settles the trade with a setting. It plays
hold‑first — hold Space to aim, release Enter to fire, hold Enter for pause —
which keeps play down to the fewest possible switch presses. **Before Each Shot:
Choose Play or Pause** (in both the main‑menu and pause settings) puts a
two‑stop choice in front of every shot: the board itself lights up for Play, and
the on‑screen Pause button in the bottom‑left corner lights up for Pause, scanned
and selected like any menu. A player who cannot sustain a hold turns it on and
is never locked out of leaving; a player who can is never slowed down by it. The
Pause button works either way. When this choice is on, holding Enter does not
pause; use the Pause choice instead.

If you are weighing this for something new: prefer keeping the *primary
gameplay action* off the scan cycle, and put the scannable pause somewhere it
does not sit between the player and the thing they came to do. Or make it a
setting, so a player who needs the scannable route can turn it on and a player
who does not is not slowed down by it.

**Hold-to-charge and timing mechanics need a select-based alternative.**

**Benny's Baseball now implements the alternative.** Its persisted setting is
**Batting: Pick a Swing / Hold to Charge**, reachable from main and pause
settings. Pick a Swing is the default when no preference is stored. The player
first selects Ready to Swing (or a stealable base or Pause) on the field.
The pitch is called aloud, the camera zooms in, and the ball freezes near its
contact location. Only then does the player select Normal, Power, Bunt, Take
Pitch, or Pause.
The ball remains frozen through scanning and pause/resume; selecting a swing
resumes the same pitch. There is no sustained press, release window, or deadline. The game
resolves contact using the swing choice, pitch location and execution quality;
it does not guarantee a hit. Scoring and season eligibility are unchanged.
The original timed charge mode remains available for players who prefer it. Both modes pair the
circular pitch highlight with plain-language text and speech: Favorable pitch,
Neutral pitch, or Difficult pitch. No symbol names or color recognition are
required. Pitch type and location affect swing matchups. The pitching selector
uses stable curved Favorable/Neutral/Risky sections, spoken risk descriptions, and preserves
choices through pause. Explanations play once per game for each swing/risk
category; later scans use short labels. Scores use large white numbers on dark cards with
team-colored borders and stripes. The occasional repeated-hit-batter warning
sequence returns everyone automatically and requires no timed response.

**Benny's Fish Mystery** asks for a press to set the hook inside the take
window, and then a sustained hold to reel. The plan is a setting that holds the
hook window open until the player scans and selects it, and that resolves the
reel in steps rather than one long press.

**Fish Mystery remains planned work; its timed version is not a bug.** The
timed form stays for players who enjoy it. The rule for providing an alternative
is in section 9, "Timing may be a challenge, never a requirement."

**Remappable keys: understood, deliberately not built.** Space and Enter are
hard{NB}coded everywhere — all 23 games compare `e.code` directly, across roughly
190 sites — so there is no setting a player can change if their hardware sends
something else.

**Why that has not mattered much.** Nearly every switch interface is configurable
on the hardware or driver side: the box is programmed to emit whichever key you
want, so a family whose interface sends the wrong thing usually fixes it there,
once, without the games changing. Remapping in the app would duplicate a knob
most players already have.

**Why it is not nothing.** Some cheap interfaces are fixed{NB}function. Some emit
mouse clicks or gamepad buttons rather than keys. And eye{NB}gaze and head{NB}tracking
users arrive through a different route again.

**The shape it would take, if it is ever built.** Not 190 edits. A translation
layer inside `scan-manager.js` is the only sane route: it already intercepts
every input in the capture phase, so it can swallow an alternative key and
re{NB}dispatch it as Space or Enter, and no game needs to know. Two cautions for
whoever does it:

- A synthetic `KeyboardEvent` has `isTrusted: false` and its `preventDefault()`
  does not suppress the real key's default action — so the *original* event must
  be `preventDefault()`ed as it is swallowed, or Space will scroll the page.
- It is the same class of change as the minimum{NB}hold check in §11: anything that
  intercepts one half of a press and not the other strands games. Deliver
  keydown and keyup as a matched pair or not at all.

Not open work. Recorded so the next person does not start by editing 23 games.

The pattern behind all three: **any interaction that requires holding a switch
should have a way through that does not.** Whether that is a menu the player
scans or the game simply supplying the value, as Football's Easy Throw does, is
a per‑mechanic call — §9 sets out how to choose. Holding is an ability, and not
every player has it. For anything new, that is a requirement and §9 states it. For
what is already here, it is the direction — the entries above are the list, and
they are not open work until someone picks one up deliberately.
