    // An on-screen keyboard, laid out and worded the way the hub's own keyboard
    // tools are - letters in ABC order rather than QWERTY, a Space key, a single
    // Backspace, and the same row-then-key drill-down every other scannable
    // keyboard in the hub uses: scan across whole ROWS first, choose one, then
    // scan across just the KEYS in it. A flat sweep of all 38 keys one at a time
    // was a special case found nowhere else in the hub, and a slower one.
    //
    // The hub's own keyboard tool drives that drill-down with its own
    // document-level Space/Enter listeners and a hold-to-escape gesture, which
    // would both fight NAF.Input's if this game loaded it as-is and which
    // ACCESSIBILITY.md section 12 asks new games to avoid (a hold gesture as the
    // only way out of somewhere is a locked door for a player who cannot sustain
    // a press). So the two levels are built the same way every other screen in
    // this game already is - as two different scan lists from
    // nameEditorScannables(), the row list while nameKbMode is 'rows' and one
    // row's keys while it is 'keys'. "Back to rows" is an invisible stop at
    // the end of a row's own keys rather than a visible button: since the
    // scan list wraps, that one stop is also what scanning backwards from
    // the row's first key lands on, so it reads as a deadzone bracketing the
    // row on both sides rather than a key of its own. It has no element to
    // highlight (see nameEditorScannables) but is still spoken, so a switch
    // user always knows where they landed even with nothing lit up. Same
    // input model as the rest of this game either way - Enter chooses
    // whatever is currently highlighted, deadzone included.
    //
    // Handled the way ACCESSIBILITY.md section 7 asks regardless: it is SPOKEN
    // the moment it opens, the scan is trapped inside it, and the safe way out
    // (Done) is always reachable - it is the LAST item in the ROW scan order,
    // which in a list that wraps means it is one scan backwards from the
    // opening position. It is not a one-way door, and a switch user who lands
    // here by a mis-scan simply leaves the name as it was.
    //
    // The text field is read-only and never takes focus (see renderNameEditor)
    // - it shows the name being spelled, it does not take one. A real keyboard
    // typing straight into it would let a name be entered without ever
    // touching the scannable keys, which is exactly the route around scanning
    // this is trying to close. Every letter comes from a key: reached by
    // scanning to its row and then to it, or - for a caregiver with a mouse or
    // a touchscreen - typed by tapping the key itself, which is the one place
    // in the game where a pointer does NOT mean "select the highlighted thing"
