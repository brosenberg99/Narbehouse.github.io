   "what": "Everything Whispering Lake is stocked with, for the Junior Warden game: the fish you tag and release, the artifacts on the bottom that become the Acoustic Sonar, and the gear ladder that gets you out to them.",
   "workflow": "Edited in editor.html, or by hand. tools/build_content.py bundles this into js/content.generated.js so the game loads one file.",
   "tagging": "Fish are never kept. You reel one in, clip a field tag on its fin, log it and let it go. The logbook is what Walt is paying for - the job is the wage, not the fish. Quest 1 is the one exception to the hook: the minnows and shiners are netted, and they go in the survey tank.",
   "depths": "Every fish has a depth band in FEET and the chart says how deep it is anywhere, so where a fish lives is a fact about the lake. The four zones are the shoreline (0-10), the shallow bay (10-35), the deep drop-off (35-75) and the abyssal trench (75-120+). A rod has a depth rating, and a line cast into deeper water than its rating is too short to reach the fish.",
   "gear": "A net nets and a rod hooks. `netOnly` fish cannot be caught on a hook and `needsHook` fish cannot be netted. A magnet turns the rod into a salvage tool; nothing on the bottom comes up without one. A rod has two numbers: castFt is how far it throws and rangeFt is how deep it fishes. Both are in feet, and the world is built at 0.61 units to the foot, so the game throws exactly the distance printed on the rod.",
   "money": "Jobs are the wage. The one exception is the growth study: Walt pays a couple of dollars a tag for the three common fish he is tracking (studyBounty), which is what fills a tank or patches a hull. It is deliberately small - it can be earned off the dock on foot, so an empty tank and an empty tin is a morning's fishing rather than a dead end, and it will never buy a motorboat.",
   "art": "Each fish carries headFacing - which way it is painted, left or right. The game hangs a landed fish from the hook in its jaw, so it has to turn the picture a quarter turn the right way round; guessing put the head-left ones upside down.",
   "depth": "depthFt is where a fish can be hooked, and it is set by the lake's summer layers rather than by what the quest ladder would find convenient. Whispering Lake stratifies: warm to about twenty-five feet, a thermocline through the thirties and forties, and cold water below that. Warmwater fish - bass, bluegill, crappie, catfish - stay above it. Coldwater fish - cisco, lake trout - live below it and cannot come up in summer. Pike, perch and walleye work the band in between. Changing a range here changes which vessel can reach that fish, so run tools/playtest.js after.",
   "litter": "Junk is what the lake gives you instead of a fish, and there are six of them so it is not the same snag every time. Anything with a value is LITTER - Walt pays a dollar or three at the counter for taking it out of the water, which is a small good deed rather than a living. The weeds are worth nothing because weeds are not litter. None of it counts as scrap: that is iron off the bottom, on a magnet.",
   "tags": "studyBounty is what Walt pays for a TAG - the fish measured, logged and put back. Every fish has one: a dollar for the shoreline minnows, five for a lake trout, and a great deal for the one nobody has landed. It is deliberately small money against the jobs, which are the wage: a trip's tags fill a tank or patch a hull. What it is never is nothing, because 'he will take that tag for $0' is the game thanking a player for their morning with a shrug."

Truth be told, I don't see many faces at all any more. Folks still buy their line and their hooks off me - I'm cheaper than town - but they don't fish here. Look out there. Not one boat on the water. Not any more. They'll tell you the lake's cursed. Something big out in the middle that takes the propeller clean off a boat. I stopped arguing about it years ago. So this is a research station now: I study what's in the water, and I write up what I find. And what I'd give to know what's down in the middle, where it drops past a hundred feet. Nobody's been out there and come back with anything but a story. Five bucks, huh? Everybody starts somewhere. What I need is a pair of young hands - we catch them, tag them, log them and put every one straight back. Nothing gets kept on my dock. Start me here: my survey tank's empty and I need to know what's growing along the shore this year. Take this hand net, scoop me up thirty minnows and shiners - a netful at a time - and I'll pay you twenty-five dollars cash. Deal? Hold on, one more thing before you go. Here's a map of the lake - take it, you're gonna need it. Whole thing's on there: the shoreline, the bay, the drop-off, and the deep water out in the middle. It won't tell you where the fish are. Nothing will. But it'll stop you getting turned around out there, and on this lake that matters.",

   "q09c": "Big Mac swore a lake monster bit his boat! But look closely - Old Whisper didn't bite it. He jammed a thick, hardened tree root straight into the drive pin! Stopped his motor dead and taught Mac a lesson. Keep your eyes open out there, kid...",
   "q10a": "I put that prop in the scrap bin - we can reuse that brass! Now, back to business.",
   "q10b": "There's a giant five-pound largemouth bass lurking in the deepest lily pads on the west side. Set your hook clean, tag her up, and let her go!",
   "q11a": "What in the world... let me see that!",
   "q11b": "It's caked in lake mud, but under the grime... that's solid brass. It looks like a frame for some old mechanical device. See these mounting brackets?",
   "q11c": "I'm setting this right here on the corner of my workbench in a tray of oil to soak off the rust. Whatever this was... it didn't sink by accident.",
   "q12a": "The sun's getting low over the trees, kid. Perfect timing for catfish!",
   "q12b": "Channel catfish feed along the muddy shallow banks right around dusk. Get two of 'em tagged and logged before you head into the dock for the night.",
   "q13a": "Logbook updated! Nice catfish.",
   "q13b": "Hey, if you've got five pieces of scrap metal in your inventory from magnet-fishing, trade 'em to me at the counter. I'll give you fifty dollars of shop credit toward your gear!",
   "q14a": "You're doing great, kid. You're almost there!",
   "q14b": "Tag and release six more shallow bay fish. Once you upload that logbook, you'll have enough cash to buy your very own yellow Kayak! No more paying daily canoe rentals.",
   "q15a": "She's all yours! That yellow Kayak is sleek, fast, and can handle deeper water.",
   "q15b": "She'll easily take you past the thirty-five-foot drop-off. Just keep an eye on her hull durability bar down at the bottom of your screen. Hitting submerged logs out there will scuff her up, but you can always bring her back to me for repairs!",
   "q16a": "Welcome to the Deep Hole, kid! The bottom drops like a cliff right past those buoys, all the way down to seventy-five feet.",
   "q16b": "Northern pike hang on the weed edge and follow the break down - thirty-five to forty-five feet is as deep as they go, and that is the deepest water your kayak will sit over. Paddle out, work the edge, and tag two of them for me.",
   "q17a": "Those northern pike put up a real fight, didn't they? Great tags.",
   "q17b": "Drop your line to the bottom in forty feet. Catfish are a warmwater fish - they hold on the mud above the cold layer and will not go down into it, whatever anybody tells you. Tag three of the big ones for me.",
   "q18a": "Aha! Look at this!",
   "q18b": "These gear teeth match the brass frame you found earlier! Look - they interlock perfectly! Whoever built this knew exactly what they were doing. Let me mount these cogs right inside the frame...",
   "q19a": "You've been putting some miles on that kayak, kid! See those scuffs on the bottom?",
   "q19b": "Bring her up to the dock workshop. A little resin patch and some scrap metal will have her running smooth again. Give it a shot!",
   "q20a": "Looks good as new!",
   "q20b": "There is a ten-pounder working the outside weed line in forty feet of water - the old ones drop down the break as the day warms. Tag her and let her go, and mind your line.",
   "q21a": "Kid... would you look at these. Fine little metal tines, packed in tight — that's not scrap, that's a comb out of a music box.",
   "q21b": "Pluck one and it hums way down low, lower than anything I'd tune for a tune. This wasn't built to play for people. Somebody built this to talk to something underwater.",
   "q22a": "Whoa — hold on, let me get a grip on that. That is heavy for a box that size.",
   "q22b": "Would you look at that seal, stamped right into the lid. Lake Warden, nineteen ninety-four. This has been sitting down there since the flood took the station.",
   "q22c": "There's a journal in here, kid. Water's got into it, but I can just make out the last page... 'The flood of ninety-four sank our underwater sanctuary station. My loyal sturgeon stayed behind to guard the baby fish. I call him...' ...and that's as far as I can get. Rest of the page is stuck together. Give me tonight to dry it out proper before it falls apart in my hands.",
   "q23a": "Kid! Dried that page out overnight, careful as I could. Warden's own hand, plain as day: 'I call him Barnaby.' Barnaby. That's not what you name a monster.",
   "q23b": "Thirty years we've all been calling him Old Whisper, blaming him for every snapped line and every bad night out there — and near as I can tell, he's just an old sturgeon doing exactly what he was told to do back in ninety-four. Guarding this place.",
   "q24a": "Logbook updated! You're doing incredible work out there.",
   "q24b": "Tag eight more deep-water fish. Upload that data, and you'll hit one thousand dollars - enough to buy my brand new motorboat!",
   "q25a": "She's all yours! A real motorboat with a steering wheel and a throttle.",
   "q25b": "But listen to me very carefully, kid. Stay away from the center fog. The water out there drops into an abyssal trench over one hundred and twenty feet deep. No boat engine has survived out there in thirty years!",
   "q26a": "I told you, kid! I warned ya!",
   "q26b": "I'm glad you're not hurt, but look at that motorboat stern - the propeller drive pin is snapped clean off, and the engine is dead. I towed you back, but that repair tab is gonna cost ya. You didn't hit a rock out there... Barnaby stopped your boat!",
   "q27a": "Barnaby doesn't mind kayaks - no noisy motors! Take your kayak back out to the edge of the fog where your boat broke down.",
   "q27b": "Magnet-fish right where you stalled out. There's gotta be one last piece of the puzzle down there!",
   "q28a": "You found the winding key! And look at this paper from the 1994 lockbox... it's a blueprint schematic!",
   "q28b": "Kid! The brass frame, the gears, the sound comb, the winding key... we haven't been building a random music box on my counter... we've been building the old Warden's Acoustic Sonar!",
   "q29a": "Hand me those three heavy scrap metal pieces! I'm using the brass from Big Mac's old prop to forge the outer housing.",
   "q29b": "Done! The Acoustic Sonar is mounted right to your motorboat stern. Instead of noisy motor vibrations, it sends out gentle, warm musical chimes that Barnaby recognizes!",
   "q30a": "Take this Pro Rod. While I do the final electrical wiring checks on the sonar, take your motorboat to the fog boundary and tag three deep lake trout at ninety feet.",
   "q31a": "A fifteen-pound lake trout from a hundred feet down! Wow! That Pro Rod handled the line tension beautifully.",
   "q31b": "You've become a master angler, kid. Truly.",
   "q32a": "Every single dollar of your repair debt is paid off from your tag bounties! You're completely square with the shop, Junior Warden.",
   "q33a": "Heavy magnet equipped, Pro Rod ready, Acoustic Sonar online.",
   "q33b": "Head out to the center fog in one hundred and twenty feet of water. Cut your engine, turn on the Acoustic Sonar, and let the music play into the water. Good luck, kid.",
   "q34a": "I hear the sonar chimes echoing through my shop radio, kid... low and warm. Keep steady out there.",
   "q34b": "Look at your sonar screen... a massive shadow is rising from a hundred feet down... it's him!",
   "q35c": "He did it! Barnaby knows the lake is in good hands now! From this day on, the deep center is an official Wildlife Sanctuary, and you are officially the Chief Junior Warden of Whispering Lake! I'm so proud of you, kid!",
   "q01a2": "Truth be told, I don't see many faces at all any more. Folks still buy their line and their hooks off me - I'm cheaper than town - but they don't fish here. Look out there. Not one boat on the water. Not any more.",
   "q01b2": "And what I'd give to know what's down in the middle, where it drops past a hundred feet. Nobody's been out there and come back with anything but a story.",
   "tackle_lost_1": "Bare line, huh? No hook, no float, nothing. Yeah. THIS is why people don't come here any more, kid - they lose a rig, then another, and they go fish somewhere sensible. Here. New hook, new float, on me. Get back out there.",
   "tackle_lost_again": "Again? Hm. Take another setup - no charge, I keep a drawer of them. Something strange about this water. One of these days I'd like to know what it is.",
   "q09_send": "Big Mac lost something out by the west weed beds back in 2008 - swore blind a lake monster bit his boat, and he has never shut up about it since. Take the magnet out there and drag the bottom. I would dearly love to know what actually happened to that motor.",
   "q11_send": "There's a shallow drop-off where the mud goes soft, and every so often somebody's magnet comes back heavier than it went down. Work that edge for me. Something metal is sitting in that mud, and I don't think it fell there on its own.",
   "q18_send": "That brass frame has empty mountings in it, kid - whatever bolted into them is still down there. The drop-off is where the frame came from, so that's where the rest of it will be. Get the magnet down deep and drag it.",
   "q21_send": "There's a log jam out in the deep water, and things collect in a log jam. If the rest of this machine went in where the frame did, the current will have walked it out that way. Take the magnet to the deep jam and see what comes up.",
   "q22_send": "Seventy-five feet, kid - the deep edge. The old Warden's station went down somewhere along there in the flood, and a station means records. That's heavy magnet work and a long haul up, but if there's anything left of ninety-four, that's where it is.",
   "q08_done": "Three good pieces of iron - that's the sonar housing sorted. Nice work with that magnet, kid.",
   "q10_done": "Five pounds if she's an ounce, tagged and swimming. That's a proper bass, kid.",
   "q17_done": "Three catfish off the mud and all three logged. You're getting the hang of the deep water.",
   "q20_done": "A ten-pound pike off the deep weed edge! Tagged, logged and back in. That's the biggest thing in this lake with teeth - well, the biggest one anybody's ever landed.",
   "walt_log_1": "In they go. Every one of them's in the book now, and every one of them's back in the water where I want it.",
   "walt_log_2": "Logged, the lot of them. That's how a survey gets done, kid - one fish at a time, week after week.",
   "walt_log_3": "Right. Names, lengths, weights, all of it down. You'd be amazed what a year of this tells you.",
   "walt_log_4": "That's the record updated. Nobody else on this lake is writing any of this down, you know.",
   "walt_log_5": "Good. The book's a little fatter than it was this morning.",
   "walt_logbig_1": "Now that one's worth the ink. I'll put a star beside it.",
   "walt_logbig_2": "Look at the size of that entry. Not many of those come across this counter, kid.",
   "walt_logbig_3": "Well now. That one's going in underlined.",
   "walt_logmany_1": "You have been busy! Hold on, let me turn the page.",
   "walt_logmany_2": "That's a proper day's work. My hand's going to ache writing this lot up.",
   "walt_logmany_3": "All of them? Good grief. Right - one at a time.",
   "walt_logone_1": "One's one, kid. The book doesn't care how fast you fill it.",
   "walt_logone_2": "In it goes. Small entries add up.",
   "walt_hold_1": "You've got a boat full there. Bring them here and I'll get them logged.",
   "walt_hold_2": "Something in the boat, I see. Let's have them in the book.",
   "walt_hold_3": "Ah, you've been out. Hand them over and I'll write them up.",
   "q23_send": "While I work on that page, there's a survey I keep putting off. Lake trout - cold-water fish, down below the thermocline where it stays cold all summer, and they will not come up for anybody. Seventy feet, kid. Tag two of them for me and put them back, and I should have something to tell you in the morning.",
   "q23c": "Which means whatever is left of that station is still out in the middle of this lake, and the middle is the one part of it neither of us can reach. Not in a kayak.",
   "walt_done_1": "That's the job done, kid. Let's settle up.",
   "walt_done_2": "Well now. That is exactly what I asked for. Bring it here and we'll square it away.",
   "walt_done_3": "Job's done, and done properly. Let's get you paid.",
   "q23_done": "Thirty years of stories, and it turns out he was only ever doing his job.",
   "q14_done": "That is the money, kid - enough for the kayak. She is tied up at the end of the boards whenever you are ready for her.",
   "q24_done": "A thousand dollars, kid. That is the motorboat paid for, whenever you want to sign for her.",
   "q25_done": "She is fuelled and tied off at the end of the boards. And kid - I meant every word about the middle of this lake.",
   "q31_done": "That is a proper day's data, kid. Now then - that repair tab of yours. Those tag bounties will square it.",
   "q33_done": "Everything checks out. Take her out, kid, and let us hear what he makes of it.",
   "walt_hello": "Well, hey there, kid!",
   "walt_moment": "Come here a second.",
   "walt_grant": "Saving up for that? I have it right here.",
   "walt_scales": "Great catch! Let's have a look at those.",
   "walt_need": "This is what I need.",
   "walt_obliged": "Much obliged, kid.",
   "walt_bought_hand": "Good choice. That is the one in your hands now.",
   "walt_bought_boat": "Good choice. That is on your boat now.",
   "q27_done": "The winding key. Well I never - that is the last of them, kid. Bring it here and let me see the lot together.",
   "q28_done": "A blueprint. Thirty years and the answer was in a box on the bottom of the lake. Right - I am going to need iron.",
   "q30_done": "Three lake trout off the bottom at ninety feet, all three tagged and back in the cold. Nobody has that data, kid. Nobody.",
   "q32_done": "Not a dollar owing. You and me are square, kid - and I am glad it was you that pulled all this up.",
   "q34_done": "You SAW him. After thirty years of stories, somebody finally saw him - and he came up to look at you. Sit down a minute, kid, before you tell me the rest.",
   "q35_send": "Then go back out there and meet him properly. Take the sonar, take your time, and whatever he does - let him do it. I will be right here on the radio.",
   "q17b_a": "Now then. There is a fish out on that breakline I have got no numbers on at all - walleye. Eyes like a cat's, feeds when the light goes flat, and gone the second the sun comes out.",
   "q17b_b": "Twenty feet down off the drop, kid. Two of them tagged and I will have something to write in the column that has been empty since ninety-four.",
   "q17b_nudge": "Two walleye, out on the breakline, twenty feet down.",
   "q17b_done": "Walleye. Both tagged, both back in. That column is not empty any more, and it is your handwriting in it.",
   "q29b_a": "One more thing before you go deep again. Every trout I have ever opened up out there had the same fish in it - cisco. Lake herring. Little silver things down in the cold layer.",
   "q29b_b": "Fifty feet and below, on live shiners. Three of them tagged, kid, and then I will know what the trout are living on out there.",
   "q29b_nudge": "Three cisco, down in the cold layer. Fifty feet and below.",
   "q29b_done": "Three cisco. That is the bottom of the whole food chain out there, written down at last - and it explains the size of what is eating them.",
   "q36_a": "Sit down a minute, Chief Warden. Something has happened out there. That fog is off the water for the first time since I was your age, and Barnaby has pulled the whole log jam apart - shoved it clean off the channel like it was brush.",
   "q36_b": "Which means the lake is calm, kid. All of it. No fog, no timber, no hull getting chewed up just for being out in the deep - you can go anywhere on this water now and take your time about it.",
   "q36_c": "And I will tell you what I think is out there. Thirty years shut behind that jam, nothing fished, nothing counted - there could be a dozen fish in this lake that are not in any book I own.",
   "q36_d": "So go and find them. Every lure in that box, every corner of the water, and no map for it - I have not got one. Ten of them, kid. Catch all ten and report back to me.",
   "q36_nudge": "Ten fish nobody has in a book. Every lure, every corner - and no, I cannot tell you where.",
   "q36_done": "Ten. TEN fish, and not one of them in a book on my shelf - a perch with no colour in it, a pike crossed with something, and a blue pike that has been extinct since before you were born. This is not a logbook any more, kid. This is a paper.",
   "q37_a": "One more thing, and it is the last I will ask of you. That bottom out there has been shut away since the sixties, and everything that ever went over the side of a boat is still lying on it.",
   "q37_b": "Heavy magnet, kid. That is the only thing that will lift what I am after. Ten unique things - not scrap, not tin cans. Things somebody lost and wanted back.",
   "q37_c": "They will be a long time coming. They are lying anywhere at all and there is one of each, so when you have got one that is the only one there is. Bring me all ten.",
   "q37_nudge": "Heavy magnet, and ten unique things off the bottom. Take your time.",
   "q37_done": "All ten. A locket with a face still in it, a watch stopped at twenty past four, and a set of tags I am going to drive round to a house tonight. You gave this lake its memory back, kid. Go on - go fishing. It is yours now.",
   "q26_send": "I know that look, kid. You are going to go and see for yourself, aren't you. Everybody does. Go on then - but keep her slow, keep your eyes up, and if that engine so much as coughs out there, you sit tight and you get on the radio. I will come and get you.",
   "q31_send": "One more piece of rod work and we are done with it. There is an old lake trout down in that trench that will go fifteen pounds - eighty feet and better, right down in the cold. That Pro Rod was built for exactly that fish. Tag her, put her straight back, and I will have the last of my numbers.",
   "q34_send": "Right then. That is everything, and it is all aboard. Out to the middle, kid, cut your engine, and let the sonar play down into it. I will have the radio on beside me the whole time - whatever happens out there, you are not out there on your own."
