  /* THE CLICK THAT ARRIVES AFTER THE TAP HAS BEEN DEALT WITH.
     A browser follows a touch with mouse events it makes up from it, and the
     last of them is a click - as much as a third of a second later.
     preventDefault() on touchend is meant to stop them, and does, as long as
     the element that was touched is still there for it to apply to.

     Choosing a row of a menu DESTROYS that element: the card re-renders and
     every row is built again. The delayed click then lands on whatever now
     sits under the finger - a row of the menu that just opened - and that
     row is a different element with its own, untouched, guard. So it fired,
     and the choice made a second choice by itself. Reported exactly: "when I
     click on one of the menus in Walt's shop it will also click on the menu
     right after that menu."

     The guard therefore cannot live on the element, because the element does
     not survive long enough to hold it. It is a moment in TIME instead: a
     click arriving within GHOST_MS of a finger touching anything at all came
     from that finger, not from somebody choosing again.
