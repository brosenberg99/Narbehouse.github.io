/**
 * Benny's FishMaster — rules, state and progression.
 *
 * A trip: leave the dock, steer the lake looking for fish, stop where they
 * are, aim a cast, charge it, and hold to reel in whatever takes it. Bring the
 * catch back to the tackle shop, turn the mission in, take the upgrade.
 *
 * The ground rule that shapes everything here: NOTHING CAN FAIL. No timers the
 * player can lose to, no damage, no game over, no way to lose a fish through
 * inaction. Every wait in this file is a wait the player may sit in forever.
 * A poor cast costs likelihood, never the trip.
 *
 * Everything timed advances from the frame loop's `dt`, never from setTimeout
 * or setInterval, so pausing genuinely freezes the bite wait, the reel, the
 * charge meter and the boat.

     WHICH GAME THIS IS

     Two ladders exist. js/data.js has 31 hand-written jobs, all of them in
     Cattail Creek, which is what the engine used to run. content/quests.json
     has the game that was actually WRITTEN: ninety jobs down six zones, with
     a keeper for each, a story about the Marigold, and an authored place on
     the map for every one. js/quests.js translates the second into the shape
     of the first.

     The written one wins when it is there. data.js stays as the fallback for
     a checkout with no built content, because "the game quietly becomes a
     different, shorter game" is the worst way for that to fail - so the
     choice is made once, out loud, at load.
