# Benny’s Bowling — Accessible Edition

A community modification of the original “Benny’s Bowling” by iliagrigorevdev, created to support players with severe mobility disabilities through single‑switch controls, clear visuals, and speech feedback. These small games can make a mega difference in someone’s life. We deeply appreciate the work done on the physics engine and other open‑source components that made this possible.

## What’s new in this Accessible Edition
- Switch‑access menus: Space scans forward; hold Space ≥3s scans backward every 2s; Enter selects/toggles.
- Scan layer at the start of every ball: the bowling ball and the Pause button are two scan objects. Space scans between them, a long hold scans backwards until the switch is released, and Enter selects. The ball is highlighted first, so a player who only ever wants to bowl just presses Enter.
- Position & Aim via Space: 5s oscillation left/right; resumes from where released; thicker aiming guide. Reached by selecting the ball from the scan layer.
- Charge & Throw via Enter: 0–5s charge with non‑linear power; quick tap = weaker, full hold = strong. A rising five‑note ladder tracks the power as it climbs, and a repeating chirp marks full charge.
- Text‑to‑Speech: English voices only (up to 8). Speaks menu focus, settings changes (ball style, alley theme), outcomes (“Strike!”), frame announcements, and final score. TTS cancels prior utterances to stay clear.
- Pause: scan to the Pause button and select it, or click it with a mouse. There is no hold‑Enter gesture — during play holding Enter charges the shot, so pause is a scan object instead. Keyboard scanning in Pause Menu (Continue, Settings, Main Menu, Help). Help speaks "I need help" without closing the pause menu.
- 1–4 Players: hot‑seat on the centre lane. Each player picks a ball colour and keeps their own scoresheet; the game names whose turn it is, skips finished players, and ranks everyone at the end. Keyboard scanning works on menus.
- Visuals: retro green/black UI; high‑contrast focus highlight; strike celebration banner.
- Themes: 10 alley themes with animated walls/backdrops and cohesive lighting; alley tint adapts to theme.
- Environment: gutter‑aware floor (center + recessed gutters), aligned side/back walls and scenic backdrop; original alley mesh hidden.
- Pins readability: pins stay bright white with very subtle lighting effects.
- Audio:
  - Ambient loop during gameplay: sound/bowling‑bg.wav (~30% volume).
  - Rolling SFX on throw: sound/rolling‑ball.wav, looped for the length of the roll and tracking the ball's speed, at 70% volume so it sits under the pin hits.
  - Aim cues (Settings → Aim Sound): soft sine blips that speed up, rise in pitch and pan towards centre as the aim converges, with a chime the moment the line will strike a pin. Tracks the pins still standing, so on a spare it rewards aiming at what's left rather than at the centre of the lane.
  - Charge cues (Settings → Charge Sound): a rising five‑note ladder, one note per 20% of power, plus a repeating chirp at full charge.
  - Per‑pin drop SFX: sound/single‑pin.mp3.
  - Music toggle uses music/music (1).mp3; respects Settings → Music.

## Run locally
Serve the folder over HTTP (some browsers restrict local file access):

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000

- `sound/bowling-bg.wav`
- `sound/rolling-ball.wav`
- `sound/single-pin.mp3`

## Accessibility notes
- One‑switch navigation across menus and pause.
- TTS limited to English voices; announces key actions and outcomes.
- High‑contrast focus styling and larger aiming guide.
