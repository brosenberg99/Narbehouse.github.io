/**
 * Benny's Ballista — physics settling and collateral damage.
 *
 * Extracted from js/game.js's stepPhysicsWithImpacts()/applyCrush() (see
 * commit history around the level editor's stability-test rewrite) so the
 * level editor's stability test can settle a candidate castle with the exact
 * same damage model the real game's boot audit (auditLevels()) uses, instead
 * of a bare P.step() that can't see a crown getting crushed in place by a
 * falling block. game.js's own stepPhysicsWithImpacts() is now a thin wrapper
 * over step() below, passing hooks for the things that are genuinely
 * game-specific (sound, score, scene teardown, splash-chain explosions) —
 * everything portable (peak-speed tracking, hp loss, crush detection) lives
 * here so both callers can never quietly drift apart.
 *
 * `recs` is any array of block-like records with these fields, mutated in
 * place: { body, mesh, mat, hp, alive, _peakSpeed, _peakResolved,
 * _lastHitSpeed }. `mesh` MUST be a real THREE.Mesh with geometry sized to the
 * block's extents — not a bare Object3D — because applyCrush()'s overlap test
 * calls Box3.setFromObject(), which needs actual geometry to compute a
 * bounding box from; a geometry-less Object3D silently produces an empty box
 * and crush damage would never fire. game.js's real blocks[] already satisfy
 * this (their mesh IS the rendered block); a caller building throwaway test
 * records — the editor's stability test — has to give each one a matching
 * BoxGeometry even though nothing ever renders it.

   * Both callers used to ask this question themselves, and they asked
   * DIFFERENT questions: each only ever compared CROWN positions, and leaned
   * on "is anything still awake at 4 seconds" to notice everything else. That
   * let a castle through whose four board frames free-fell eight units and
   * shattered on landing the instant it loaded — no crown was touched, so the
   * only check that could object was the sleep deadline, and whether a pile of
   * debris has gone quiet by an arbitrary 4-second mark is a stopwatch race
   * that Bullet resolves differently depending on what the physics world did
   * beforehand. The editor won that race and shipped the level; the game lost
   * it and refused to boot.

   * anything DIE, from merely being stood up? Both are facts about the castle
   * rather than about the clock, both are decided long before any deadline,

   * for genuine jitter, but it is no longer the only thing standing between a
   * collapsing castle and a clean verdict.
   *
   * Every entry carries the `rec` it describes, so a caller can name the
   * failure in whatever coordinates it knows about (the editor has cell
   * provenance on `rec.spec`; the game has the material and a world position)
   * without this needing to know about either.
