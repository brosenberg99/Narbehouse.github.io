/**
 * Benny's Ballista — paper-craft art kit.
 *
 * Every model is built procedurally out of chunky, flat-shaded primitives with
 * a shared paper-fibre texture, which is what sells the folded-paper diorama
 * look without shipping a single asset file. Ported from BENNYSRACETRACKS'
 * art.js core (paperTexture / paper / glow / outline / ink / part / setShadow,
 * lines 1-205 there) — byte-identical except for the road/cloud/hill helpers
 * this game has no use for, which were dropped rather than carried as dead
 * code (see AGENTS.md and the ballista-3d plan on FishMaster's world.js wart).
 *
 * Two rules run through all of it:
 *   1. Big, round, saturated shapes — toy-like rather than realistic.
 *   2. Anything the player must react to gets a dark ink outline. It reads as
 *      craft-paper edging and it is the cheapest way to buy the contrast
 *      Ben's low vision needs — every block gets one, and so does the crown.

  /* Why the crossbow is hand-built while the base is generated.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     A crossbow is a T in PLAN view: a rail running downrange, a prod
     crossing it at the FRONT, strings drawn back to a catch at the rear.
     (Bryan's top-down reference was twice misread here as a front
     elevation, which produced a bow with a handle in the same plane — an
     arc, with no depth along the firing axis at all. A three-quarter view
     hides that error, and the in-game camera IS three-quarter, so
     screenshots were the least diagnostic thing to judge it by. The check
     that settles it is the mesh's own top-down silhouette against the
     reference's: flat line vs T.)

     Image-to-mesh generation never landed that shape. Across six concept
     attempts it produced, in turn: an arc; a prod at the wrong end; one
     limb at the front-left and another at the rear-right (two L's rather
     than a prod); and a rail skewed enough that mirroring the good half
     doubled it into an A-frame. Each repair uncovered the next defect,
     because the reconstruction was never structurally a crossbow.

     A crossbow is also trivial geometry — a rail, two mirrored limbs, a
     string, a bolt. Built from primitives it is exactly symmetric by
     construction rather than by hope, it reads at any size (which is the
     whole point for Ben — see the accessibility notes), and it can be
     genuinely two-tone: a baked model is repainted ONE flat palette
     colour at runtime, so wood-vs-steel separation is impossible for it
     but free here. That is Bryan's call, made after seeing the two L's.

     The base stays generated: a wheeled cart has surface detail worth
     having and it reconstructed cleanly. */
