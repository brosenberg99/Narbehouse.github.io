/**
 * Benny's Ballista — level data and the ASCII-layer parser.
 *
 * A castle is a stack of 2D ASCII pictures, front layer first (nearest the
 * ballista) — same letters and merge rule as the old 2D game's single-picture
 * `LEVELS`, extended with depth. Two merges happen, both only for
 * `mergeable` materials (never small rubble, never a one-off piece like `T`
 * or `K`):
 *
 *   - ROW merge (x). A run of the same letter side by side in one row welds
 *     into one wide rigid body, exactly as the 2D version did.
 *   - LAYER merge (z). The *same* run (same row, same columns, same letter)
 *     repeated in the next layer back welds into one deep body too, so a
 *     wall drawn identically on several layers is one slab, not N thin
 *     plates standing shoulder to shoulder.
 *
 * Because layers sit in their own z-slice with no vertical overlap between
 * them, **each layer has to stand on its own** — a block only rests on
 * whatever is directly below it in the *same* layer. That is what makes a
 * front wall a genuine sightline obstruction rather than a support for
 * anything behind it: knock it down and the layers behind are unaffected
 * structurally, only newly visible/reachable.
 *
 * Authoring tricks that carry over unchanged from the 2D game, now doubled
 * by having a Z axis as well as an X one:
 *   - CLADDING. Put `S` in front of a `W` (same row, same column, earlier
 *     layer) and the wood is armoured — a shot has to get through the stone
 *     first.
 *   - WINDOWS. Put `I` in front of anything and the same shot shatters the
 *     glass and carries on into whatever it was hiding.
 *   - DEPTH. A solid front layer can hide a back layer's crown from a flat
 *     shot entirely — reaching it needs a lob that clears the front layer's
 *     height, or knocking the front layer down first.

     * arrow-slit over the right gate and a plain merlon top; the glass never
     * sits in front of the centre column, so it's flavour, not a shoot-twice
     * trap. The left gate's first draft was only 2 cols wide with the crown
     * behind it sitting at the gate's own EDGE — a genuinely uncomfortable
     * shot at sweep speed (AGENTS.md's hold-to-sweep rule wants targets
     * forgiving enough to hit), which is reason enough on its own to widen
     * it. It also happened to expose a real bug worth remembering: the
     * now-removed reachability audit's coarse direct-hit grid missed that
     * narrow a window outright and fell through to a real-physics
     * simulation tier whose result depended on simulation order — passing
     * on a warm test session but failing on a genuine fresh boot. Widened to
     * 5 cols with the crown re-centred in it — better to aim at either way,
     * and (at the time) verified clean across multiple fresh boots too.
     * Layer 1 (courtyard): an EASY crown directly behind the left gate, one
     * layer to clear, no deeper obstruction — a second, shallower difficulty
     * tier the way Powder Row/Bastion escalate within one level. A powder
     * keg sits loose behind the right gate purely as a hazard/flavour (nothing
     * depends on destroying it), plus one small wood-rubble chunk on bare
     * ground — both isolated on open floor, the only placement `w`/`s`/`i`
     * chunks are safe in (see The Timberworks' lone `s` for the precedent;
     * a small chunk under a full-size block would be a narrow, likely
     * unstable support, so this file never does that).
     * Layer 2 (tower): twin pillars, TALLER than The Siege Tower's (10 rows
     * vs 9), with a timber board near the top and a steel brace lower down
     * — different material, different row, so neither merges with the
     * other or with anything in an adjacent layer.
     * Layer 3 (keep): the HARD crown, three layers deep, on a wider stone
     * altar than The Siege Tower's single-block plinth. */
